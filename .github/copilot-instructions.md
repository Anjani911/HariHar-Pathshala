# React Native Expo Project Instructions

This is a React Native project built with Expo and TypeScript that can run on Expo Go.

## Key Guidelines:
- Use TypeScript for all new components and screens
- Follow React Native best practices and use Expo SDK APIs when possible
- Use Expo Router for navigation if implementing multiple screens
- Ensure all components are compatible with Expo Go (avoid custom native modules)
- Use StyleSheet for styling and follow React Native styling conventions
- Implement responsive design that works on both iOS and Android
- Use Expo's built-in APIs for device features (camera, location, etc.)

## Project Structure:
- Keep components in separate files for reusability
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Follow consistent naming conventions for files and components
- Organize assets in the assets folder
